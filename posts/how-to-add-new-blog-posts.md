## Welcome to Your First Blog Post! üéâ

This post serves as both a welcome message and a practical example of how to create new blog posts on this Eleventy-powered site. Whether you're documenting your coding journey, sharing tutorials, or writing about your latest projects, this guide will help you get started.

## Why This Blog Exists

This blog is designed to be a simple, fast, and developer-friendly platform for sharing technical content. Built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), it focuses on:

- **Performance**: Lightning-fast static site generation
- **Simplicity**: Write in Markdown, deploy with Git
- **Flexibility**: Easy to customize and extend
- **Developer Experience**: Local development with hot reload

## Step-by-Step: Creating a New Blog Post

### 1. Create the Markdown File

Navigate to the `/posts` directory and create a new `.md` file. Use a descriptive, URL-friendly filename:

```bash
# Good examples:
posts/getting-started-with-react.md
posts/docker-development-setup.md
posts/javascript-async-patterns.md
```

### 2. Add the Front Matter

At the top of your new file, add the front matter block with metadata:

```yaml
---
layout: base.njk
title: "Your Awesome Post Title"
permalink: /blog/your-post-slug/
date: 2025-08-12
tags: ["javascript", "tutorial", "web-development"]
description: "A brief description of your post for SEO and social sharing."
---
```

**Field Explanations:**
- `layout`: Always use `base.njk` for blog posts
- `title`: The main title displayed on the page
- `permalink`: The URL path (should match your filename)
- `date`: Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `tags`: Array of relevant tags for categorization
- `description`: Brief summary for SEO and social media

### 3. Write Your Content

After the front matter, write your content using Markdown syntax. Here are some examples:

#### Code Blocks
Use triple backticks with language specification for syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// Example JavaScript code
function greetUser(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the blog.`;
}

console.log(greetUser("Developer"));
```

```bash
# Terminal commands
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Lists and Links

- Create **bold** and *italic* text
- Add [links to external resources](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- Use `inline code` for commands and variables

#### Images

```markdown
![Alt text for your image](/images/your-image.jpg)
```

### 4. Test Locally

Before publishing, always preview your changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080/blog/your-post-slug/` to see how it looks.

### 5. Publish Your Post

Once you're happy with the content:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(blog): add new post about [topic]"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site!

## Best Practices for Blog Posts

### Content Organization
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Break up long paragraphs
- Include code examples when relevant
- Add links to external resources

### SEO Optimization
- Write descriptive titles (50-60 characters)
- Include relevant tags
- Add meta descriptions
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H2, H3, etc.)

### Code Examples
- Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
- Include comments in your code
- Show both the code and expected output when helpful

## Multi-Language Support

This blog supports multiple languages. For non-English posts, add these fields to your front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: base.njk
title: "–í–∞—à –∑–∞–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–æ–∫ —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—é"
lang: uk
permalink: /uk/blog/your-post-slug/
translationKey: "unique-post-identifier"
date: 2025-08-12
---
```
